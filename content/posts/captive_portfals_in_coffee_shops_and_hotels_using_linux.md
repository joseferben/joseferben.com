## What are Captive Portals? {#what-are-captive-portals}

Captive portals are those web pages that _magically_ open once you connect to some public WiFi. Sometimes you have to fill in your Email address or phone number to receive a code, but often you just have to confirm some terms of services.

On Linux they don't work reliably, which is extra frustrating because you know that you are one click away from having an internet connection.

This is a collection of links that you can try manually to land on those captive portals.
