I am happy to announce [Schablone](<https://github.com/joseferben/schablone>). Schablone is a minimal boilerplate project for Django with strong opinions and little options for customization.

<!--more-->

Schablone is a [cookiecutter](<https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter>) project that is heavily inspired by the famous [django-cookiecutter](<https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django>).

Schablone makes some pretty strong assumptions. It will speed up your app creation if you agree with them. I won't go into details in this post because the project's README.md does that already.

The deployment is documented in the generated project's [README.md](<https://github.com/joseferben/schablone/blob/main/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D/README.md>).
