This is a practical guide on how to minimize suffering and maximize joy in your life.

<!--more-->

Imagine a _sage_, someone who mastered their mind, spirit and body. Someone who is enlightened and is free from all suffering.


## Many reasons to get upset {#many-reasons-to-get-upset}

You shop for groceries. You sit at the table eating dinner with your family. You are working on a problem at work with a colleague.

These everyday scenarios have the potential for you to experience negative emotions. You might get slightly inconvenienced by something the cashier does at the grocery store. Maybe you don't even pick it up consciously. Another time you get deeply hurt by a loved one over dinner. The situation might escalate and you find yourselves in a bad argument.

In our daily lives, there are many situations and reasons to get hurt or feel upset. Is there a way to suffer less from those seemingly negative situations? I think so. And I also think that everyone can get there.


## From vibrations to suffering {#from-vibrations-to-suffering}

A way to go about it is to analyze an example situation. I will use the idea of a _sage_, an ideal person that mastered their own mind, spirit and body. Someone that is enlightened and acts as a guiding figure.

Let's over analyze following situation: We are about to pay for our groceries and the cashier is rude to us.

1.  The cashier uses their vibrating vocal cords to generate airwaves
2.  Airwaves are traveling to our ear and pushing our ear drums
3.  Our brain converts signals into human language
4.  Our brain understands what was said (subject, object, action, ...)
5.  We interpret the meaning of what was said
6.  An emotion is creeping up on us, quickly and barely noticeable
7.  We compulsively act on that emotion
8.  We suffer from that emotion, which turns it into a negative emotion
9.  Our brain's chemistry is in a state of suffering

These steps happen very fast and mostly subconsciously. Within a split second we reached step 8. It's easy to draw the conclusion that the cashier made us suffer. After all, they used their vocal chords to change our brain's chemistry to a state of suffering!

In reality, it is us and our compulsiveness that caused our suffering.


## Acting compulsively vs. acting consciously {#acting-compulsively-vs-dot-acting-consciously}

Acting compulsively means to act by instinct. Acting by instinct is useful to survive. There is a reason we evolved to have compulsiveness in us. Animals around us are acting mostly by instinct. Thanks to their instinct they know what to eat and what not to eat. They know how to swim without having touched water.

Humans however can not afford that kind of luxury. Acting by instinct for a human, for a homo _sapiens_, means to go against its nature.

Take a homo sapiens from 70'000 years ago and one from today. They biologically the same animals. With our great intellect we built a world that is very different from 70'000 years ago. In a world built by intellect, instinct and compulsion becomes a burden.

Most people in developed countries don't profit from fear of the dark. Or the fear of spiders. Or the craving for sugar and fat.

Following instincts ensured our survival back when it was about survival. Today, we could be _living_ instead of surviving. Overcoming mere surviving means to act rationally and consciously. It means to act according to man's nature.

-   not robot (empathy, openness)
-   humans are animals, we have reflexes (sun) and instincts for good reasons
-   need to be managed well
-   those management skills are underdeveloped, not useful in economy
-   ok for first initial negative reaction, but be not overwhelmed by it
-   related back yo step 6


## All human experience comes from within {#all-human-experience-comes-from-within}

The key insight is that _all human experience comes from within_.

-   hedonic adaptionation (explain)
-   if think otherwise, you are enslaved by your environment
    -   you give people the power to change the chemicals inside your brain


## Feeling negative emotions vs. suffering {#feeling-negative-emotions-vs-dot-suffering}

-   How to: empathy, openness (no assumptions)
-   Decision diagram with outcome -&gt; you should not be bothered
-   goal is not to never feel negative emotions


## The sage at the cashier {#the-sage-at-the-cashier}

-   acts as if he is angry, is softly smiling inside, name the guy who reacts compulsive on the cashiers remark
-   useful for survival, show boundaries, minimize suffering in the future
-   if the sage is reading this
    -   forgive me for not seeing everything

You can only truly enjoy your wealth, if you are ready to be homeless and poor anytime. In the same way, you can only have a joyful life if you are ready to die anytime. Everyday the plane takes off I am ok to die, that is how I conquered my fear of flying
