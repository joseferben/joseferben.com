I recently migrated a Next.js project to Remix in order to improve performance and maintainability. These are the good parts and the bad parts of Remix.

<!--more-->


## tl;dr {#tl-dr}

The migrated Next.js app can be described as follows:

-   10 file based routes
-   50 components
-   Tailwind for styling
-   deployed on Vercel

After the migration to Remix and using Cloudflare Workers as deployment target, following changed:

-   10-15% performance improvement ([Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/))
-   5-10% smaller code base

The migration itself was mostly straightforward with minor hiccups around SSR third-party React components.


## The migration {#the-migration}

The Next.js app had a clean separation of pages and components. Each component contained its own style and logic. Some of the logic was extracted using hooks for easier re-use across multiple components.

Both Next.js and Remix are React frameworks with decent support for Tailwind. After setting up the initial structure, migrating the React components was as easy as going through all of their dependencies and replacing every package with a `@next` scope.


### Images {#images}

Next.js provides a solid [&lt;Image&gt;](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) component that works nicely out of the box. The component does quiet a bit of heavy lifting and I only realized its scope when I had to find a replacement.
Remix does not come with a comparable solution. At the time of writing, there is [remix-image](https://github.com/Josh-McFarlin/remix-image).

```typescript
<Image
  src="https://asset.example.org/image.png"
  responsive={[
    {
      size: { width: 100, height: 100 },
      maxWidth: 500,
    },
    {
      size: { width: 600, height: 600 },
    },
  ]}
  dprVariants={[1, 3]}
/>
```

I decided to use the available asset service of the client to create renditions and setting `srcset` manually. I ended up with a smaller, less powerful, custom version of Next.js' `<Image>`.


### Routing {#routing}

Both Remix and Next.js have file based routing. You create a path hierarchy by creating files that export React components (and other things).

Both frameworks come with their `<Link>` components to abstract away client side routing and data fetching. Replacing the Next.js version with the Remix version was trivial.

Remix brings nested routes to the table. Strictly speaking, the router of Remix can do everything that Next.js can do. It should be possible to keep the routes and the file structure of a Next.js app and just keep using them in the Remix app.

However, in order to take advantage of proper error propagation and better data reading for child pages, I switched to Remix's `<Outlet>` for nested pages.
Outlets are a way of telling a component "this is the place where your children will be rendered" inside you.
The children pages bring their own loader and action functions. They know how to read their own data and they provide the logic to handle data writes such as form submissions.

This allowed me to replace custom client-server HTTP POST code with [fetcher](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/remix#usefetcher) or even [&lt;Form&gt;](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/remix#form). Remix gives you "loading" or "pending" states for free, no need to do that manually.

```typescript
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState<boolean>(false)
const [isSubmitted, setIsSubmitted] = useState<boolean>(false)

useEffect(() => {
  if (isSubmitted) {
    setIsLoading(true)
    // submit here
    .finally(() => setIsLoading(false))
    setIsLoading(false)
  }
}, [isSubmitted])
```


### SSR {#ssr}

The most painful part of the migration was SSR with third-party components (= React components from NPM). On the client, both Next.js and Remix are just running React. Consequentially, what worked on the client on Next.js works on Remix.

Rendering on the server is a different story, and with Remix it's not an easy one. Many third party React components have a section about SSR. Unfortunately, the instructions are valid for Next.js, maybe sometimes for Gatsby. It seems that Remix is not yet a first-class React framework among React developers.

The component that I am still not able to render on the server is [react-select](https://react-select.com/) because of its use of emotion. A workaround using `<ClientOnly />` from [remix-utils](https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-utils) did the trick.

```typescript
import Select from "react-select"
import { ClientOnly } from "remix-utils"

const CustomDropdown = () => {
  return (
    <ClientOnly>
      <Select />
    </ClientOnly>
  )
}
```

It is important to render lace holders or empty components to avoid layout shift when the client-side rendering kicks in. In this case, the width depends on the rendered data. Hard coding `w-64` fixed the issue.

```typescript
import Select from "react-select"
import { ClientOnly } from "remix-utils"

const CustomDropdown = () => {
  return (
    <div className="w-64">
      <ClientOnly>
        <Select />
      </ClientOnly>
    </div>
  )
}
```


## Remix vs. Next.js {#remix-vs-dot-next-dot-js}


### Remix pros {#remix-pros}

-   **Nested routes**: A powerful abstraction that allows the framework to optimize data fetching and provide an excellent DX by making error handling simpler
-   **Data writes**: Remix provides mechanisms to submit forms and to do other data writes
-   **Use the platform**: There is a certain simplicity in using what is provided by the browser. The community seems to favor copying and adjusting snippets over adding another dependency. I see similarities to the Go community, where people say "a little bit of duplication is better than an additional dependency".
    The official Remix Stacks are project templates that you adjust to your needs. There is no meta Remix framework that tries to abstract things away for you.
-   **Faster**: Remix is 10-15% faster with the same code base. Keep in mind that the two deployment targets are different. Next.js was deployed to Vercel and Remix is deployed to Cloudflare Workers. Performance testing was done using WebPageTest.org, web.dev and Lighthouse.


### Remix cons {#remix-cons}

-   **Small ecosystem**: Next.js has better support in the React SSR ecosystem. Helper components like `<Image>` are part of Next.js, while Remix does not officially have that component.
-   **Little Q&amp;A material**: The community is smaller and most of the answers are provided on the Remix Discord, which is not indexed by Google or Bing. Whenever I encounter issues, I run a query on Google and another one on Discord.
-   **No specialized hosting platform**: Remix is built to be runtime agnostic, so it runs on the edge or on Node.js. The documentation and the community recommend to deploy Remix to fly.io or Cloudflare.
    However, there is no integrated solution like Vercel that is specialized in hosting Remix apps.


### Verdict {#verdict}

Both are great frameworks that make developing React apps a joy.

Remix is younger and more cutting edge. The documentation is good, but if things go wrong you better be ready to hop on the Discord or read the source code (which is a good idea anyway ðŸ˜›).

Nested routes and a unified way to read and write data is a big step into the right direction.

At the time of writing, the ecosystem is trying to figure out how to build cool things on top of the novel but solid abstractions that Remix provides. Some third-party React components that work flawlessly with Next.js are painful to use with Remix SSR.
